            <p>The term big data has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for
                popularizing the term.
                Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to
                capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.
                Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, however the main
                focus is on unstructured data.

                A 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as
                follows:[44]

                Techniques for analyzing data, such as A/B testing, machine learning, and natural language processing
                Big data technologies, like business intelligence, cloud computing, and databases
                Visualization, such as charts, graphs, and other displays of the data
                Multidimensional big data can also be represented as OLAP data cubes or, mathematically, tensors. Array
                database systems have set out to provide storage and high-level query support on this data type.
                Additional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensor-based computation,[45] such
                as multilinear subspace learning,
                massively parallel-processing (MPP) databases, search-based applications, data mining,[47] distributed
                file systems, distributed cache (e.g., burst buffer and Memcached), distributed databases, cloud and
                HPC-based infrastructure (applications, storage and computing resources),[48] and the Internet.[citation
                needed] Although, many approaches and technologies have been developed, it still remains difficult to
                carry out machine learning with big data.[49]

                Some MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the
                ability to load, monitor, back up, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS.

                Big data analytics has helped healthcare improve by providing personalized medicine and prescriptive
                analytics, clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics, waste and care variability reduction,
                automated external and internal reporting of patient data, standardized medical terms and patient
                registries and fragmented point solutions.
                Some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented. The level of data generated
                within healthcare systems is not trivial. With the added adoption of mHealth, eHealth and wearable
                technologies the volume of data will continue to increase. This includes electronic health record data,
                imaging data, patient generated data, sensor data, and other forms of difficult to process data. There
                is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information
                quality.
                "Big data very often means 'dirty data' and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume
                growth." Human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health
                service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed.
                While extensive information in healthcare is now electronic, it fits under the big data umbrella as most
                is unstructured and difficult to use.[74] The use of big data in healthcare has raised significant
                ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights, privacy and autonomy, to transparency and
                trust.[75]

                Big data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research, as
                data-driven analysis can move forward more quickly than hypothesis-driven research.
                Then, trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional, hypothesis-driven follow up biological
                research and eventually clinical research.

                A McKinsey Global Institute study found a shortage of 1.5 million highly trained data professionals and
                managers[44] and a number of universities[81][better source needed] including University of Tennessee
                and UC Berkeley, have created masters programs to meet this demand. Private boot camps have also
                developed programs to meet that demand, including free programs like The Data Incubator or paid programs
                like General Assembly.[82] In the specific field of marketing, one of the problems stressed by Wedel and
                Kannan[83] is that marketing has several sub domains (e.g., advertising, promotions, product
                development, branding) that all use different types of data. Because one-size-fits-all analytical
                solutions are not desirable, business schools should prepare marketing managers to have wide knowledge
                on all the different techniques used in these subdomains to get a big picture and work effectively with
                analysts.
